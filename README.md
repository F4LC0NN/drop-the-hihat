This project highlights DOM manipulation with an interact keyboard drum kit.

In this project, I will showcase DOM manipulation with Javascript.
I will create a page that will play a sound whenever a button is pressed.

Here are the subgoals:

- When a button is pressed, play a sound,
- When a button is pressed, hightlight it dynamically,
- When a button is released, revert its appearance back to its original state,
- Skip all buttons that are not linked to a sound,
- Organize the css, js and assets files in separated directories,
- Use bubbling & capturing to trigger the events
